# Game Center

The game center has a main menu that allows users to either play a game or quit the program. If the user chooses to play a game, they are presented with a list of games to choose from, along with the number of points required to play each game. The user can then choose a game to play, and if they have enough points, the game will start and the required number of points will be deducted from their total. If the user wins the game, points are added to their total.
